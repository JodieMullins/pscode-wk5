WEEK 5, INTRO COURSE 2, HOMEWORK:

// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

let num1 = 6
let num2 = 5
let sum = num1 + num2




// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the case that a number is divisible by 2, let it equal even

in the case that a number is not evenly divisible by 2, let it be odd

a number is divible by 2 if the remainder of its division is 0

a number is odd if the remainder of the division of a number and 2 comes out to be 1 or greater





// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a)
for every number 1 - 5:
create a value equal to an integer within a range of 1 - 100 
let the index start from 0

b)
for every number that was calculated in the steps above, add those together and divide the sum by the number equal to 5

c) for every number that was indexed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4: tell me the smallest value in the list
Now give me the largest value in the list

d) log to the console for the user to see the output:

	-b > print("AVERAGE:" + " " + RESULTS)

	- c1 > Minimum Value in List = 
        - c2 > Maximum Value in List -
